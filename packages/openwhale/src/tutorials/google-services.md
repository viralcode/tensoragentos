# Google Services

Access Google Calendar, Gmail, Drive, and Tasks.

## Setup

All Google services use the same credentials. You only need to set this up once.

### Step 1: Create Google Cloud Credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project (or select existing)
3. Go to **APIs & Services → Library**
4. Enable these APIs:
   - Google Calendar API
   - Gmail API  
   - Google Drive API
   - Google Tasks API
5. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**
6. Click **Create Credentials → OAuth client ID**
7. Choose **Web application** type
8. Add authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:7777/auth/google/callback`
9. Click **Create** and download the JSON

### Step 2: Configure in Dashboard

1. Open **http://localhost:7777/dashboard**
2. Go to **Skills** tab
3. Find any Google skill (Calendar, Gmail, etc.)
4. Click **Configure**
5. **Paste the entire credentials JSON** into the text area
6. Click **Save**
7. Click **Authorize** and complete the Google login

That's it! All Google services will now work.
